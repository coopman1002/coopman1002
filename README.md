# 👋 Hi, I'm Mike Coopman

I'm a **Systems Security Engineer (SSE) & DevSecOps practitioner** passionate about building secure, automated, and scalable infrastructure.  
I focus on **RHEL hardening, compliance automation, continuous monitoring, and infrastructure-as-code** — blending security and operations into repeatable workflows.

---

## 🧠 What I Do

- 🛡️ As an **ISO and System Security Engineer (SSE)**, I implement and manage **NIST 800-53 controls** and perform system hardening.  
- 🧾 Develop and maintain **security authorization packages** supporting **Authority to Operate (ATO)** and **eMASS** compliance documentation.  
- ⚙️ Perform **SecOps** and **Shift-Left Security Operations**, integrating security into every stage of development.  
- 🧰 Build and manage **containers** using **Podman** and **Docker**, focusing on secure baselines and OCI compliance.  
- 📊 Design **Splunk dashboards** that automate **NIST 800-53 control checks** for continuous monitoring and compliance reporting.  
- 🧾 Use the **Atlassian suite (JIRA, Confluence, Bitbucket, Artifactory)** for version control, collaboration, and workflow automation.  
- 💻 Develop automation scripts in **Ansible, PowerShell, and Bash** to streamline STIG and SCAP compliance.  
- 🏃‍♂️ In my free time, I enjoy running, spending time with family, and watching my daughter play soccer and gymnastics at Dayton Christian.

## 🧱 Projects & Highlights

### 🔹 RHEL 8 STIG Hardening Playbook
Automated STIG compliance enforcement using Ansible with modular roles, STIG ID tagging, and SCAP integration for validation.  
➡️ Includes configurable `defaults/main.yml`, STIG XML output callback, and audit evidence collection.

### 🔹 Distributed Splunk Architecture
Designed and deployed a **multi-indexer, clustered search head** Splunk environment with Syslog-NG and SC4S for log ingestion.  
Includes dashboards for patching status, authentication monitoring, and insider-threat detection.

### 🔹 Continuous Monitoring Framework
Built a **control validation system** that maps Splunk queries and Ansible checks directly to NIST 800-53 controls,  
automatically generating evidence and reporting compliance drift.

### 🔹 Container Security & OCI Compliance
Built and maintained **RHEL UBI-based OCI containers** for internal tools and STIG testing, using GitHub for version control and automation pipelines.
