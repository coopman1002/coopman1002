# 👋 Hi, I'm Mike Coopman

I'm a **Systems Security Engineer & ISSO** passionate about building secure, automated, and scalable infrastructure.  
I focus on **RHEL hardening, compliance automation, continuous monitoring, and infrastructure-as-code** — blending security and operations into repeatable workflows.

---

## 🧠 What I Do

- 🛡️ Implement **NIST 800-53** and **DISA STIG** compliance automation with Ansible, Bash, and PowerShell.  
- 📊 Architect and deploy **distributed Splunk environments** for continuous monitoring and event correlation.  
- 🧰 Build and manage **containerized applications** with **Podman**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes** (including Minikube and OpenShift).  
- 🧾 Develop **compliance dashboards and POA&M workflows** integrated with JIRA and Confluence.  
- 🧩 Design **high-availability infrastructure** using Hyper-V, vSphere, and hybrid warm-site failover solutions.

## 🧱 Projects & Highlights

### 🔹 RHEL 8 STIG Hardening Playbook
Automated STIG compliance enforcement using Ansible with modular roles, STIG ID tagging, and SCAP integration for validation.  
➡️ Includes configurable `defaults/main.yml`, STIG XML output callback, and audit evidence collection.

### 🔹 Distributed Splunk Architecture
Designed and deployed a **multi-indexer, clustered search head** Splunk environment with Syslog-NG and SC4S for log ingestion.  
Includes dashboards for patching status, authentication monitoring, and insider-threat detection.

### 🔹 Continuous Monitoring Framework
Built a **control validation system** that maps Splunk queries and Ansible checks directly to NIST 800-53 controls,  
automatically generating evidence and reporting compliance drift.

### 🔹 Container Security & OCI Compliance
Built and maintained **RHEL UBI-based OCI containers** for internal tools and STIG testing, using GitHub for version control and automation pipelines.
